  description: |
    This is the API specification for the Digital Commerce Checkout API. It provides operations for:
    - Order capture with tokenised payment methods (credit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay)
    - Order capture with stored payment methods (gift vouchers)
    - Cart validation and order creation
    - 3DS authentication flow support with validate-capture endpoints
    - Complete 3D Secure authentication and order completion

    **Payment API Integration**: This API is aligned with Payment API v0.3.0 for payment
    processing schemas, ensuring consistency in address structures (ISO 19160), 3DS flows,
    and payment token handling.

    # Endpoint Types:

    The Checkout API includes two types of endpoints, each suited to different use cases:

    ## 1. **Me API Endpoints:**
      - *Purpose:* Designed for personalised customer experiences on websites.
      - *Signature:* Includes `/me` in the URL.
      - *Example:* `POST /me/token/capture` (Captures order for the authenticated user).
      - *Access:* Requires an access token that identifies the specific user, including brand, market, and customer_nbr claims.
      - *Use Case:* Ideal for checkout processes on e-commerce sites where customers manage their own orders.

    ## 2. **Stateless API Endpoints (Per-Brand):**
      - *Purpose:* Used for broader applications, such as call centres or backend services, where actions are performed on behalf of multiple customers.
      - *Signature:* Includes `/in-brand/{brandkey}` in the URL.
      - *Example:* `POST /in-brand/{brandkey}/token/capture` (Captures order within the specified brand).
      - *Access:* Requires a higher authority token and is scoped per brand, identified by the `brandkey` path parameter.
      - *Use Case:* Suitable for customer service representatives managing orders across different brands or for backend services handling multi-customer operations.

    # Authorisation:

    ## Getting Access Tokens
    All Checkout API endpoints require OAuth 2.0 access tokens for authorisation:

    - **For RESTful API Access:** Contact the Curity OAuth Identity Server team for credentials and token endpoint details.

    ## Token Requirements

    - **For `/me` Endpoints:**
      - Guest users: Token must contain an anonymous identity claim
      - Registered users: Token must contain a customer identity claim
      
    - **For `/in-brand/{brandkey}` Endpoints:**
      - Requires a service account token with appropriate scopes for the specified brand

    # Concurrency Control:

    Order capture is immutable: orders are created once and always have `version: 1`. Concurrency control today applies only to the cart you are checking out (via its `version` in the request, returning 409 if stale). A future Amendments API may allow post-checkout changes; then the order `version` will increment and be required for optimistic concurrency. Store it now; use `Idempotency-Key` (not `version`) for safe retries of the same capture request.

    ---
    # AWS API Gateway Base Path Mapping:

    **Important:** AWS API Gateway automatically prefixes `/checkout` to all endpoint paths through its base path mapping feature. This means:
    - The paths defined in this specification (e.g., `/me/token/capture`) will be accessible as `/checkout/me/token/capture`
    - No manual `/checkout` prefix is needed in the OpenAPI specification paths

    ---
    # Order Capture Process:

    The Order Capture process involves two main steps:

    ## 1. Business Validations
    - **Cart validation**: Item availability, delivery restrictions, cart state
    - **Amount matching**: Ensuring payment amounts match cart totals
    - **Customer validation**: Delivery address, customer status

    ## 2. Payment Processing
    - **Tokenised payments**: Credit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay (via existing Payments API)
    - **Stored payments**: Gift vouchers and other stored payment methods
    - **3DS handling**: Complete 3D Secure authentication flow support:
      - Initial capture returns 202 with authentication requirements
      - Customer completes 3DS challenge
      - Validate-capture endpoints complete the order creation

    ## Order Object Design

    The `Order` object is designed as an intuitive extension of the familiar `Cart` object:
    - **All Cart fields preserved**: lineItems, totalPrice, shippingInformation, etc.
    - **Added order status**: completed (orders only exist when payment succeeds)
    - **Added payment details**: Shows exactly how the order was paid
    - **Same Money objects**: Consistent monetary formatting with Cart API

    This approach makes orders immediately understandable - they're "just carts that have been paid for" with clear payment information.

    ## Delivery Address Handling

    **Important:** Delivery address information must be configured within the Cart object before checkout. The Checkout API does not accept delivery address overrides.

    **Process Flow:**
    1. **Cart Setup**: Delivery address must be set on the cart using the Cart API
    2. **Address Validation**: Cart validates delivery restrictions and shipping options
    3. **Checkout**: Checkout API uses the delivery address from the cart
    4. **Order Creation**: Final order inherits all cart delivery information

    For delivery address management, see the Cart API documentation.

    # 3D Secure Authentication Flow

    The Checkout API provides complete support for 3D Secure (3DS) authentication through a two-step process:

    ## Step 1: Initial Order Capture
    - Call `/me/token/capture` or `/in-brand/{brandkey}/token/capture`
    - If 3DS is required, receive **HTTP 202 Accepted** with:
      - `threeDSSessionId`: Unique session identifier
      - `challengeInfo`: Complete challenge information including stepUpUrl and stepUpToken
      - `paymentContext`: Payment amount and method details
      - `status` and `timestamp`: Session status and expiry tracking

    ## Step 2: Complete 3DS Authentication
    - After customer completes the 3DS challenge
    - Call `/me/3ds/validate-capture` or `/in-brand/{brandkey}/3ds/validate-capture`
    - Submit the `threeDSSessionId` and 3DS completion data (CAVV, ECI, transaction ID)
    - Receive **HTTP 201 Created** with the completed order

    ## Important Notes
    - Authentication sessions expire after 30 minutes
    - Each session can only be used once
    - The original cart must remain unchanged between steps
    - Failed 3DS validation returns HTTP 422 with validation errors

    ---
    # REST-Compliant Status Codes

    This API follows REST best practices for HTTP status codes, which differs from some payment industry conventions:

    ## Our Approach
    - **201 Created**: Used when an order is successfully created and payment is captured. The response includes a `Location` header pointing to the new order resource.
    - **202 Accepted**: Used when 3D Secure authentication is required. The request has been accepted but requires further customer action. No order exists yet.
    - **422 Unprocessable Entity**: Used for business validation failures. No order is created.

    ## Industry Context
    Many payment providers (e.g., Stripe, Adyen) use HTTP 200 for all successful API calls, relying on response body fields to indicate actual transaction status. We've chosen a more REST-compliant approach where HTTP status codes directly reflect the operation outcome:
    - Resource created → 201
    - Further action required → 202
    - Validation failed → 422

    This makes our API more self-documenting and easier to integrate, as developers can rely on standard HTTP semantics.

    # Payment Decline Handling

    ## Why Payment Declines Return HTTP 422

    Payment declines return **HTTP 422 (Business Validation Error)**, not HTTP 200. This differs from the Payment API's design.

    **Why Different from Payment API?**
    - **Checkout API**: Creates orders → Payment decline means no order created → HTTP 422
    - **Payment API**: Processes payments → Transaction attempt succeeded → HTTP 200

    **Multiple Payment Support:**
    Orders can use multiple payment methods (e.g., £30 gift card + £70 credit card). If any payment fails, all are rolled back and no order is created.

    **Consistent Error Handling:**
    All checkout failures (stock issues, delivery restrictions, payment declines) return HTTP 422, enabling uniform client-side error handling.

    ### Client Implementation

    ```javascript
    try {
      const order = await checkout(cart, payments);
      redirectToOrderConfirmation(order.id);
    } catch (error) {
      if (error.status === 422) {
        const { orderLevel, lineItemLevel } = error.validations;

        // Filter payment-related errors
        const paymentErrors = orderLevel.filter(v =>
          ['PaymentDeclined', 'InsufficientFunds', 'CardExpired'].includes(v.code)
        );

        if (paymentErrors.length > 0) {
          promptForAlternativePayment(paymentErrors);
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    **Payment Decline Example:**
    ```json
    HTTP 422
    {
      "orderLevel": [
        {
          "code": "PaymentDeclined",
          "message": "Payment was declined by the card issuer."
        }
      ],
      "lineItemLevel": []
    }
    ```

    **No order created** - cart remains unchanged for retry with alternative payment.

    # Checkout Validation Handling Guide

    ## Understanding Checkout Validations

    The Checkout API performs comprehensive business validations during order capture to ensure data integrity and business rule compliance. When validation issues occur, a `422 Business Validation Error` response is returned with detailed validation information.

    ### Validation Categories

    **Order-Level Validations:** Issues affecting the entire checkout process
    - Cart state problems (not found, version mismatch, empty/locked)
    - Payment issues (amount mismatch, insufficient funds, declined)
    - Delivery restrictions

    **Line Item-Level Validations:** Issues with specific products
    - Stock availability (out of stock, insufficient quantity)
    - Product availability (discontinued, not saleable)
    - Compliance restrictions (regulatory, shipping limitations)
    - Quantity limits (exceeds maximum per order)

    ### Client Implementation Guidelines

    **1. Process All Validations**
    ```json
    {
      "orderLevel": [
        {"code": "PaymentAmountMismatch", "message": "..."}
      ],
      "lineItemLevel": [
        {"code": "ItemOutOfStock", "message": "...", "lineItemId": "abc123"}
      ]
    }
    ```

    **2. Use Validation Codes for Localization**
    - **Recommended**: Use the `code` field to implement localized user messages
    - **Not Recommended**: Display the English `message` field directly to users
    - The `message` field is intended for developers and debugging

    **3. Present Issues by Category**
    - Group order-level issues as general checkout problems
    - Group line item-level issues by the affected products
    - Use `lineItemId` to map validations back to cart line items

    **4. Require Resolution Before Retry**
    - All validation issues must be resolved before resubmitting
    - Order is NOT created when validation errors occur
    - Users must take corrective action (adjust quantities, change address, etc.)

    ### Common Integration Patterns

    **Handle Multiple Issues:**
    ```javascript
    if (response.status === 422) {
      const validations = response.data;

      // Process order-level issues
      validations.orderLevel.forEach(validation => {
        displayOrderError(validation.code, validation.message);
      });

      // Process line item issues
      validations.lineItemLevel.forEach(validation => {
        displayLineItemError(validation.lineItemId, validation.code, validation.message);
      });
    }
    ```

    **Localization Example:**
    ```javascript
    function getLocalizedMessage(validationCode) {
      const messages = {
        'ItemOutOfStock': t('checkout.errors.item_out_of_stock'),
        'PaymentAmountMismatch': t('checkout.errors.payment_mismatch'),
        // ... other codes
      };
      return messages[validationCode] || t('checkout.errors.generic');
    }
    ```

      summary: Capture order for authenticated customer
      description: |
        Captures an order from a cart for the authenticated customer. This operation
        performs final business validations on the cart and processes payment using
        the provided payment methods.
        
        **Process Flow:**
        1. **Cart Validation**: Verifies cart state, item availability, delivery restrictions (using cart's delivery address)
        2. **Payment Processing**: Processes tokenised and/or stored payment methods
        3. **Order Creation**: Creates order with payment details, status, and delivery information from cart

        **Response Codes:**
        - **201 Created**: Order successfully created, payment captured
        - **202 Accepted**: 3DS authentication required, order pending customer action
        - **422 Unprocessable Entity**: Business validation failed, no order created
        
        **Payment Methods Supported:**
        - **Tokenised**: Credit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay (via Payments API)
        - **Stored**: Gift vouchers and other stored payment methods
        - **Multiple**: Can combine multiple payment methods (e.g., gift voucher + credit card)
        
        **3DS Support:**
        - If 3DS authentication is required, returns HTTP 202 with authentication details
        - Provides 3DS challenge URL for customer completion
        - Use Payments API `/3ds/validate-capture` endpoint to complete after 3DS

        **Address Handling:**
        - **Delivery Address**: Must be configured on the cart before checkout (no override supported)
        - **Billing Address**: Optional override for payment processing; defaults to delivery address if not provided
        - Cart API should be used to set and validate delivery address before checkout

        **Example usage:**

      summary: Complete 3DS authenticated order for authenticated customer
      description: |
        Completes order creation after successful 3D Secure authentication for the
        authenticated customer. This endpoint is called after the customer successfully
        completes the 3DS challenge presented in the 202 response from `/me/token/capture`.

        **Process Flow:**
        1. **Initial Capture**: Call `/me/token/capture` → receive HTTP 202 with threeDSSessionId
        2. **3DS Challenge**: Redirect customer to 3DS URL for authentication
        3. **Completion**: Call this endpoint with threeDSSessionId and 3DS results
        4. **Order Creation**: Server validates 3DS data and creates order

        **Response Codes:**
        - **201 Created**: Order successfully created after 3DS validation
        - **409 Conflict**: Authentication session already used or expired
        - **422 Unprocessable Entity**: 3DS validation failed or cart no longer valid

        **3DS Data Flow:**
        - Receives completion phase data from 3DS authentication
        - Validates with Payment API `/3ds/validate-capture` endpoint
        - Creates order using original cart and payment details from session

        **Session Management:**
        - Authentication sessions expire after 30 minutes
        - Sessions can only be used once
        - Original cart must still be valid and unchanged

      summary: Capture order within specified brand
      description: |
        Captures an order from a cart within the specified brand. This operation is intended
        for authenticated agents acting on behalf of customers, such as call center 
        representatives or backend services.
        
        **Process Flow:**
        1. **Brand Validation**: Verifies brandkey and agent permissions
        2. **Cart Validation**: Verifies cart state, item availability, delivery restrictions (using cart's delivery address)
        3. **Payment Processing**: Processes tokenised and/or stored payment methods
        4. **Order Creation**: Creates order with payment details, status, and delivery information from cart

        **Response Codes:**
        - **201 Created**: Order successfully created, payment captured
        - **202 Accepted**: 3DS authentication required, order pending customer action
        - **422 Unprocessable Entity**: Business validation failed, no order created
        
        **Payment Methods Supported:**
        - **Tokenised**: Credit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay (via Payments API)
        - **Stored**: Gift vouchers and other stored payment methods
        - **Multiple**: Can combine multiple payment methods (e.g., gift voucher + credit card)
        
        **3DS Support:**
        - If 3DS authentication is required, returns HTTP 202 with authentication details
        - Provides 3DS challenge URL for customer completion
        - Use Payments API `/in-brand/{brandkey}/3ds/validate-capture` endpoint to complete after 3DS

        **Address Handling:**
        - **Delivery Address**: Must be configured on the cart before checkout (no override supported)
        - **Billing Address**: Optional override for payment processing; defaults to delivery address if not provided
        - Cart API should be used to set and validate delivery address before checkout

        **Example usage:**

        `POST /checkout/in-brand/uklait/token/capture`
      operationId: captureOrderInBrand
      parameters:

      summary: Complete 3DS authenticated order within specified brand
      description: |
        Completes order creation after successful 3D Secure authentication within the
        specified brand. This endpoint is called after the customer successfully
        completes the 3DS challenge presented in the 202 response from
        `/in-brand/{brandkey}/token/capture`.

        **Process Flow:**
        1. **Initial Capture**: Call `/in-brand/{brandkey}/token/capture` → receive HTTP 202 with threeDSSessionId
        2. **3DS Challenge**: Redirect customer to 3DS URL for authentication
        3. **Completion**: Call this endpoint with threeDSSessionId and 3DS results
        4. **Order Creation**: Server validates 3DS data and creates order

        **Response Codes:**
        - **201 Created**: Order successfully created after 3DS validation
        - **409 Conflict**: Authentication session already used or expired
        - **422 Unprocessable Entity**: 3DS validation failed or cart no longer valid

        **3DS Data Flow:**
        - Receives completion phase data from 3DS authentication
        - Validates with Payment API `/in-brand/{brandkey}/3ds/validate-capture` endpoint
        - Creates order using original cart and payment details from session

        **Session Management:**
        - Authentication sessions expire after 30 minutes
        - Sessions can only be used once
        - Original cart must still be valid and unchanged

        **Agent Usage:**
        This endpoint is intended for authenticated agents acting on behalf of customers,
        such as call center representatives or backend services.

        **Example usage:**

        Unique key to prevent duplicate transactions. This will be implemented by
        the underlying PSP where supported.
          A unique header that payment service providers (PSPs) use to detect and reject—or silently replay—the same unsafe request (e.g. POST /in-brand/{brandkey}/token/capture) within their retention window.

          If the key has already been used:
          • Many PSPs replay the original 2xx/4xx response.
          • Some _(e.g. Worldline; Stripe when params differ)_ reply `409 Conflict`.

          This guards against accidental double-charges on retries.
          -  **Example (Cybersource suggestion):** `C12318814253057`.   _merchantIdLast4 + JulianDay + hhmmss + counter — 15 chars._
          -  **Example (Worldline suggestion):**  
            _Worldline expects any unique value (typically a UUID). Keys are kept for 24 h; a duplicate request replays the first response or returns `409 Conflict` if the initial call is still processing._
          - **Any globally-unique value is valid**—you can just as easily send a UUID or another timestamp-based key—so long as you reuse the *same* value on every retry of the same request.

          This is **not** to be confused with `version`, which enforces optimistic concurrency on API-managed resources such as carts or customers.

        ## Checkout Validation Codes

        The system uses standardized codes to indicate specific checkout validation issues:

        ### Order-Level Validation Codes
        | Code | Description |
        |------|-------------|
        | `CartNotFound` | The specified cart does not exist or is not accessible |
        | `CartVersionMismatch` | The cart version has changed since the checkout request was made |

        data obtained after the customer successfully completes the 3DS challenge.

        **Process Flow:**
        1. Customer completes 3DS challenge via the redirect URL
        2. Client receives 3DS completion data (CAVV, ECI, transaction ID)
        3. Client submits this request to complete the order
        4. Server validates 3DS data with Payment API
        5. Server creates order if validation succeeds

        **Alignment with Payment API v0.3.0:**
        The threeDSData structure uses the phase-based discriminator model from
        Payment API v0.3.0, specifically the "completion" phase.

        ## Business Validation Errors

        A 422 is returned when the checkout data is structurally correct but there are business validation
        issues that prevent order completion. The response contains detailed validation information organized
        by order-level and line item-level issues.

        ### Validation Structure
        - **Order Level**: Issues affecting the entire order (payment, delivery, cart state)
        - **Line Item Level**: Issues specific to individual line items (stock, compliance)

        ### Common Validation Scenarios
        **Order-Level Issues:**
        * `CartNotFound` - Cart does not exist or is not accessible
        * `CartVersionMismatch` - Cart was modified after checkout initiated
        * `InvalidCartState` - Cart is empty, locked, or invalid
        * `PaymentAmountMismatch` - Payment amounts don't match cart total
        * `DeliveryRestriction` - Delivery unavailable to specified address

        **Payment Issues:**
        * `PaymentDeclined` - Generic payment decline from processor
        * `CardDeclined` - Credit/debit card declined by issuer
        * `CardExpired` - Payment card has expired
        * `InsufficientFunds` - Insufficient gift voucher balance
        * `InvalidCardDetails` - Card details invalid or incomplete
        * `PaymentProcessorError` - Processor error during transaction
        * `FraudSuspected` - Payment blocked due to fraud detection
        * `PaymentMethodNotSupported` - Payment method not supported

        **Line Item Issues:**
        * `ItemUnavailable` - Item no longer available for purchase
        * `ItemOutOfStock` - Requested quantity exceeds available stock
        * `ComplianceRestriction` - Regulatory restrictions prevent sale
        * `QuantityExceedsLimit` - Quantity exceeds maximum allowed
