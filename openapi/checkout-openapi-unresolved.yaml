    This is the API specification for the Digital Commerce Checkout API. It provides operations for:
    - Order capture with tokenised payment methods (credit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay)
    - Order capture with stored payment methods (gift vouchers)
    - Cart validation and order creation
    - 3DS authentication flow support

    **Payment API Integration**: This API is aligned with Payment API v0.2.0 for payment
    processing schemas, ensuring consistency in address structures (ISO 19160), 3DS flows,
    and payment token handling.

    # Endpoint Types:

    The Checkout API includes two types of endpoints, each suited to different use cases:

    ## 1. **Me API Endpoints:**
      - *Purpose:* Designed for personalised customer experiences on websites.
      - *Signature:* Includes `/me` in the URL.
      - *Example:* `POST /me/token/capture` (Captures order for the authenticated user).
      - *Access:* Requires an access token that identifies the specific user, including brand, market, and customer_nbr claims.
      - *Use Case:* Ideal for checkout processes on e-commerce sites where customers manage their own orders.

    ## 2. **Stateless API Endpoints (Per-Brand):**
      - *Purpose:* Used for broader applications, such as call centres or backend services, where actions are performed on behalf of multiple customers.
      - *Signature:* Includes `/in-brand/{brandkey}` in the URL.
      - *Example:* `POST /in-brand/{brandkey}/token/capture` (Captures order within the specified brand).
      - *Access:* Requires a higher authority token and is scoped per brand, identified by the `brandkey` path parameter.
      - *Use Case:* Suitable for customer service representatives managing orders across different brands or for backend services handling multi-customer operations.

    # Authorisation:

    ## Getting Access Tokens
    All Checkout API endpoints require OAuth 2.0 access tokens for authorisation:

    - **For RESTful API Access:** Contact the Curity OAuth Identity Server team for credentials and token endpoint details.

    ## Token Requirements

    - **For `/me` Endpoints:**
      - Guest users: Token must contain an anonymous identity claim
      - Registered users: Token must contain a customer identity claim
      
    - **For `/in-brand/{brandkey}` Endpoints:**
      - Requires a service account token with appropriate scopes for the specified brand

    # Concurrency Control:

    Order capture is immutable: orders are created once and always have `version: 1`. Concurrency control today applies only to the cart you are checking out (via its `version` in the request, returning 409 if stale). A future Amendments API may allow post-checkout changes; then the order `version` will increment and be required for optimistic concurrency. Store it now; use `Idempotency-Key` (not `version`) for safe retries of the same capture request.

    ---
    # AWS API Gateway Base Path Mapping:

    **Important:** AWS API Gateway automatically prefixes `/checkout` to all endpoint paths through its base path mapping feature. This means:
    - The paths defined in this specification (e.g., `/me/token/capture`) will be accessible as `/checkout/me/token/capture`
    - No manual `/checkout` prefix is needed in the OpenAPI specification paths

    ---
    # Order Capture Process:

    The Order Capture process involves two main steps:

    ## 1. Business Validations
    - **Cart validation**: Item availability, delivery restrictions, cart state
    - **Amount matching**: Ensuring payment amounts match cart totals
    - **Customer validation**: Delivery address, customer status

    ## 2. Payment Processing
    - **Tokenised payments**: Credit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay (via existing Payments API)
    - **Stored payments**: Gift vouchers and other stored payment methods
    - **3DS handling**: Support for 3D Secure authentication flows

    ## Order Object Design

    The `Order` object is designed as an intuitive extension of the familiar `Cart` object:
    - **All Cart fields preserved**: lineItems, totalPrice, shippingInformation, etc.
    - **Added order status**: completed (orders only exist when payment succeeds)
    - **Added payment details**: Shows exactly how the order was paid
    - **Same Money objects**: Consistent monetary formatting with Cart API

    This approach makes orders immediately understandable - they're "just carts that have been paid for" with clear payment information.

    ## Delivery Address Handling

    **Important:** Delivery address information must be configured within the Cart object before checkout. The Checkout API does not accept delivery address overrides.

    **Process Flow:**
    1. **Cart Setup**: Delivery address must be set on the cart using the Cart API
    2. **Address Validation**: Cart validates delivery restrictions and shipping options
    3. **Checkout**: Checkout API uses the delivery address from the cart
    4. **Order Creation**: Final order inherits all cart delivery information

    For delivery address management, see the Cart API documentation.

    # REST-Compliant Status Codes

    This API follows REST best practices for HTTP status codes, which differs from some payment industry conventions:

    ## Our Approach
    - **201 Created**: Used when an order is successfully created and payment is captured. The response includes a `Location` header pointing to the new order resource.
    - **202 Accepted**: Used when 3D Secure authentication is required. The request has been accepted but requires further customer action. No order exists yet.
    - **422 Unprocessable Entity**: Used for business validation failures. No order is created.

    ## Industry Context
    Many payment providers (e.g., Stripe, Adyen) use HTTP 200 for all successful API calls, relying on response body fields to indicate actual transaction status. We've chosen a more REST-compliant approach where HTTP status codes directly reflect the operation outcome:
    - Resource created → 201
    - Further action required → 202
    - Validation failed → 422

    This makes our API more self-documenting and easier to integrate, as developers can rely on standard HTTP semantics.

    # Checkout Validation Handling Guide

    ## Understanding Checkout Validations

    The Checkout API performs comprehensive business validations during order capture to ensure data integrity and business rule compliance. When validation issues occur, a `422 Business Validation Error` response is returned with detailed validation information.

    ### Validation Categories

    **Order-Level Validations:** Issues affecting the entire checkout process
    - Cart state problems (not found, version mismatch, empty/locked)
    - Payment issues (amount mismatch, insufficient funds, declined)
    - Delivery restrictions

    **Line Item-Level Validations:** Issues with specific products
    - Stock availability (out of stock, insufficient quantity)
    - Product availability (discontinued, not saleable)
    - Compliance restrictions (regulatory, shipping limitations)
    - Quantity limits (exceeds maximum per order)

    ### Client Implementation Guidelines

    **1. Process All Validations**
    ```json
    {
      "orderLevel": [
        {"code": "PaymentAmountMismatch", "message": "..."}
      ],
      "lineItemLevel": [
        {"code": "ItemOutOfStock", "message": "...", "lineItemId": "abc123"}
      ]
    }
    ```

    **2. Use Validation Codes for Localization**
    - **Recommended**: Use the `code` field to implement localized user messages
    - **Not Recommended**: Display the English `message` field directly to users
    - The `message` field is intended for developers and debugging

    **3. Present Issues by Category**
    - Group order-level issues as general checkout problems
    - Group line item-level issues by the affected products
    - Use `lineItemId` to map validations back to cart line items

    **4. Require Resolution Before Retry**
    - All validation issues must be resolved before resubmitting
    - Order is NOT created when validation errors occur
    - Users must take corrective action (adjust quantities, change address, etc.)

    ### Common Integration Patterns

    **Handle Multiple Issues:**
    ```javascript
    if (response.status === 422) {
      const validations = response.data;

      // Process order-level issues
      validations.orderLevel.forEach(validation => {
        displayOrderError(validation.code, validation.message);
      });

      // Process line item issues
      validations.lineItemLevel.forEach(validation => {
        displayLineItemError(validation.lineItemId, validation.code, validation.message);
      });
    }
    ```

    **Localization Example:**
    ```javascript
    function getLocalizedMessage(validationCode) {
      const messages = {
        'ItemOutOfStock': t('checkout.errors.item_out_of_stock'),
        'PaymentAmountMismatch': t('checkout.errors.payment_mismatch'),
        // ... other codes
      };
      return messages[validationCode] || t('checkout.errors.generic');
    }
    ```

      summary: Capture order for authenticated customer
      description: |
        Captures an order from a cart for the authenticated customer. This operation
        performs final business validations on the cart and processes payment using
        the provided payment methods.
        
        **Process Flow:**
        1. **Cart Validation**: Verifies cart state, item availability, delivery restrictions (using cart's delivery address)
        2. **Payment Processing**: Processes tokenised and/or stored payment methods
        3. **Order Creation**: Creates order with payment details, status, and delivery information from cart

        **Response Codes:**
        - **201 Created**: Order successfully created, payment captured
        - **202 Accepted**: 3DS authentication required, order pending customer action
        - **422 Unprocessable Entity**: Business validation failed, no order created
        
        **Payment Methods Supported:**
        - **Tokenised**: Credit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay (via Payments API)
        - **Stored**: Gift vouchers and other stored payment methods
        - **Multiple**: Can combine multiple payment methods (e.g., gift voucher + credit card)
        
        **3DS Support:**
        - If 3DS authentication is required, returns HTTP 202 with authentication details
        - Provides 3DS challenge URL for customer completion
        - Use Payments API `/3ds/validate-capture` endpoint to complete after 3DS

        **Address Handling:**
        - **Delivery Address**: Must be configured on the cart before checkout (no override supported)
        - **Billing Address**: Optional override for payment processing; defaults to delivery address if not provided
        - Cart API should be used to set and validate delivery address before checkout

        - Stateless Checkout API
      summary: Capture order within specified brand
      description: |
        Captures an order from a cart within the specified brand. This operation is intended
        for authenticated agents acting on behalf of customers, such as call center 
        representatives or backend services.
        
        **Process Flow:**
        1. **Brand Validation**: Verifies brandkey and agent permissions
        2. **Cart Validation**: Verifies cart state, item availability, delivery restrictions (using cart's delivery address)
        3. **Payment Processing**: Processes tokenised and/or stored payment methods
        4. **Order Creation**: Creates order with payment details, status, and delivery information from cart

        **Response Codes:**
        - **201 Created**: Order successfully created, payment captured
        - **202 Accepted**: 3DS authentication required, order pending customer action
        - **422 Unprocessable Entity**: Business validation failed, no order created
        
        **Payment Methods Supported:**
        - **Tokenised**: Credit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay (via Payments API)
        - **Stored**: Gift vouchers and other stored payment methods
        - **Multiple**: Can combine multiple payment methods (e.g., gift voucher + credit card)
        
        **3DS Support:**
        - If 3DS authentication is required, returns HTTP 202 with authentication details
        - Provides 3DS challenge URL for customer completion
        - Use Payments API `/in-brand/{brandkey}/3ds/validate-capture` endpoint to complete after 3DS

        **Address Handling:**
        - **Delivery Address**: Must be configured on the cart before checkout (no override supported)
        - **Billing Address**: Optional override for payment processing; defaults to delivery address if not provided
        - Cart API should be used to set and validate delivery address before checkout

        **Example usage:**

        `POST /checkout/in-brand/uklait/token/capture`
      operationId: captureOrderInBrand

        the underlying PSP where supported.
          A unique header that payment service providers (PSPs) use to detect and reject—or silently replay—the same unsafe request (e.g. POST /in-brand/{brandkey}/token/capture) within their retention window.

          If the key has already been used:
          • Many PSPs replay the original 2xx/4xx response.
          • Some _(e.g. Worldline; Stripe when params differ)_ reply `409 Conflict`.

          This guards against accidental double-charges on retries.
          -  **Example (Cybersource suggestion):** `C12318814253057`.   _merchantIdLast4 + JulianDay + hhmmss + counter — 15 chars._
          -  **Example (Worldline suggestion):**  
            _Worldline expects any unique value (typically a UUID). Keys are kept for 24 h; a duplicate request replays the first response or returns `409 Conflict` if the initial call is still processing._
          - **Any globally-unique value is valid**—you can just as easily send a UUID or another timestamp-based key—so long as you reuse the *same* value on every retry of the same request.

          This is **not** to be confused with `version`, which enforces optimistic concurrency on API-managed resources such as carts or customers.

        ## Checkout Validation Codes

        The system uses standardized codes to indicate specific checkout validation issues:

        ### Order-Level Validation Codes
        | Code | Description |
        |------|-------------|
        | `CartNotFound` | The specified cart does not exist or is not accessible |
        | `CartVersionMismatch` | The cart version has changed since the checkout request was made |
        | `InvalidCartState` | The cart is in a state that prevents checkout (empty, locked, etc.) |
        | `PaymentAmountMismatch` | Payment amounts do not match cart total |
        | `DeliveryRestriction` | Delivery is not available to the specified address |
        | `InsufficientFunds` | Insufficient funds on gift voucher or stored payment method |
        | `PaymentDeclined` | Payment was declined by the payment processor |

        ### Line Item-Level Validation Codes
        | Code | Description |
        |------|-------------|
        | `ItemUnavailable` | The line item is no longer available for purchase |
        | `ItemOutOfStock` | The requested quantity exceeds available stock |
        | `ComplianceRestriction` | The item cannot be sold due to regulatory restrictions |
        | `QuantityExceedsLimit` | The requested quantity exceeds the maximum allowed for this item |

        These codes help clients implement appropriate handling for each validation scenario.

        ## Business Validation Errors

        A 422 is returned when the checkout data is structurally correct but there are business validation
        issues that prevent order completion. The response contains detailed validation information organized
        by order-level and line item-level issues.

        ### Validation Structure
        - **Order Level**: Issues affecting the entire order (payment, delivery, cart state)
        - **Line Item Level**: Issues specific to individual line items (stock, compliance)

        ### Common Validation Scenarios
        **Order-Level Issues:**
        * `CartNotFound` - Cart does not exist or is not accessible
        * `CartVersionMismatch` - Cart was modified after checkout initiated
        * `InvalidCartState` - Cart is empty, locked, or invalid
        * `PaymentAmountMismatch` - Payment amounts don't match cart total
        * `DeliveryRestriction` - Delivery unavailable to specified address
        * `InsufficientFunds` - Insufficient gift voucher balance
        * `PaymentDeclined` - Payment declined by processor

        **Line Item Issues:**
        * `ItemUnavailable` - Item no longer available for purchase
        * `ItemOutOfStock` - Requested quantity exceeds available stock
        * `ComplianceRestriction` - Regulatory restrictions prevent sale
        * `QuantityExceedsLimit` - Quantity exceeds maximum allowed

        > **Client Implementation**: Process all validations and present issues to users for resolution before resubmitting.
